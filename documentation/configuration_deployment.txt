CONFIGURATION AND DEPLOYMENT

The Milk & Bakery Management System requires specific configuration and follows a defined deployment process:

1. Application Configuration:
- appsettings.json for main configuration
- Connection string for SQL Server database
- AppSettings section for application-specific settings
- FolderPath setting for SAP file storage
- Logging configuration for error and information logging
- AllowedHosts for CORS configuration

2. Database Configuration:
- SQL Server connection string with:
  - Data Source (server name)
  - Initial Catalog (database name)
  - User ID and Password authentication
  - MultipleActiveResultSets enabled
  - TrustServerCertificate enabled
  - Encrypt enabled
- Database schema managed through Entity Framework Migrations
- Seed data initialization through DbInitializer

3. Development Environment:
- .NET SDK 6.0 or higher required
- SQL Server (Express or full version)
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code recommended
- NuGet package management
- Entity Framework Core tools for migrations

4. Setup Process:
- Clone repository
- Restore NuGet packages with dotnet restore
- Update database schema with dotnet ef database update
- Configure connection string in appsettings.json
- Run application with dotnet run
- Access through https://localhost:7112 or http://localhost:5089

5. Deployment Configuration:
- launchSettings.json for development profiles
- IIS Express configuration for local development
- HTTPS and HTTP binding support
- Environment variables for configuration
- Multiple profiles for different deployment scenarios

6. CORS Configuration:
- AllowAll policy configured in Program.cs
- Allows any origin, method, and header
- Applied to all endpoints through middleware

7. Session and Caching Configuration:
- Session middleware for user state management
- Memory cache configuration for performance
- 5-minute cache duration for dashboard statistics
- Notyf configuration for toast notifications

8. Background Services Configuration:
- InvoiceBackgroundService registered as hosted service
- CratesManagementBackgroundService registered as hosted service
- Automatic startup with application
- Graceful shutdown handling

9. Middleware Configuration:
- ExceptionHandlingMiddleware for global error handling
- CORS middleware for cross-origin requests
- Session middleware for user state
- Static files middleware for wwwroot content
- Routing middleware for endpoint mapping
- Authorization middleware for access control

10. Build and Deployment Process:
- Build with dotnet build command
- Publish with dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish
- Framework-dependent or self-contained deployment options
- IIS deployment support
- Cloud deployment compatibility (Azure, etc.)
- Environment-specific configuration files

11. Security Considerations:
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Session-based authentication
- Role-based authorization
- Connection string security
- No explicit mention of password hashing
- Input validation through model binding

12. Performance Optimization:
- Memory caching for dashboard data
- Database indexing for frequently queried columns
- Efficient Entity Framework queries
- Background processing for long-running tasks
- Asynchronous operations where appropriate
